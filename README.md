## Description

The Cash-Landrum Incident is one of the most disturbing and well-documented UFO encounters in history, primarily because of the severe physical injuries allegedly suffered by the witnesses. On the evening of December 29, 1980, Betty Cash, Vickie Landrum, and Vickie's seven-year-old grandson Colby encountered a large diamond-shaped object emitting intense heat and flames while driving on a rural road near Huffman, Texas. The object was reportedly accompanied by military helicopters, leading to speculation about secret government technology or a military recovery operation.

Following their close encounter, all three witnesses developed severe health problems consistent with acute radiation exposure: hair loss, nausea, diarrhea, burns, eye damage, and other symptoms. Betty Cash, who had the closest and longest exposure, required hospitalization and suffered debilitating health effects for the rest of her life. The witnesses pursued legal action against the U.S. government, claiming military involvement and demanding compensation for their injuries, but the government denied any knowledge of the event or ownership of the craft.

What makes this case particularly significant is the documented medical evidence of the victims' injuries, the consistency of their accounts, the presence of multiple witnesses, and the alleged involvement of military helicopters. The case raises disturbing questions about secret military technology, human exposure to unknown phenomena, government accountability, and the potential dangers of close UFO encounters.
